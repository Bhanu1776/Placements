## About internship
-> This summer i've interned from my clg itself as a fullstack developer, i and 5 other colleagues built a webapp based on nextjs its actually a college website specific to IT dept.

this all started when, one day my class teacher came up to me and said will you work as an intern to build a webapp related to clg.. i said yess maam what all requirements you have. she came up with certain features and she guided me how to should work. so i agreed with maam she wanted me to lead this project. i picked 5 best developers from my class and we started working on this project. 

while leading this project i've learned so many things, i got to know how to handle team effectively how actually the process of sdlc life cycle comes into the picture. and many more at the end i enjoyed working with my team it was a great experience. 

project management tools like asana and notion

## Jellyfish-x-retro
Actually theres a short story, idk whether it's a bad habit or good habit whenever i found any product is intresting i get deeper into that, what i mean is. i always been curios how it is built which tech they used to build this product. in vscode case i've researched how microsoft build this amazing product later i got to know vscode is built with a javscript framework called electron.

i've somewhere heard about electron framework which is used to build desktop applications for styling it uses generic css only.. 

then i got an idea why not to build a theme i started and got to know microsoft limited theming in json only.. then i somehow got an unofficial way to theme vscode with css .. i added cool animations which bydefault vscode doesn't allow to do soo and thats where my theme make a big difference than other themes which were published in vscode 

By this time i am so happy that users are downloading in very large numbers. that really fascinates me!
